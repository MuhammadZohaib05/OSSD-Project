# OSSD-Project

# 🎮 Mini Game Hub

## 📌 Description

**Mini Game Hub** is a desktop application built using Python’s Tkinter library, featuring two engaging mini-games. Developed collaboratively by three teams as part of the **Open Source Software Development (OSSD)** course, the project demonstrates practical skills in GUI programming, GitHub-based collaboration, and backend integration with SQLite for score storage.

## 🚀 Feature Summary

- ❌⭕**Game 1: Tic Tac Toe** – A turn-based strategy game where two players (X and O) take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- 🧩 **Game 2: Memory Matching Game** – A concentration game where players flip over two tiles at a time, trying to find matching pairs. The game tracks moves and displays a win message when all pairs are matched.
- ✊✋✌️ **Game 3: Rock Paper Scissors** – A classic hand-sign battle game where the player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors against a randomly selected computer move. The winner is decided based on traditional         rules and displayed after each round.
- 🕹️ **Main Hub Interface** – Central screen with options to launch each game, view credits, and exit.
- 💾 **Score Tracking** – Persistent storage using SQLite for storing and retrieving scores.
- 📦 **Modular Code** – Organized structure for each game and backend logic.
- 🔁 **Collaborative Git Workflow** – Each team worked with separate branches and PRs, enabling clean integration.
